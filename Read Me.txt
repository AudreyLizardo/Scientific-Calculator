This is a calculator that is smart enough to round to the correct number of significant digits, and put the answer in scientific notation if necessary.

Disclaimer: Only use program with decimal, negative sign, and numbers. Do not attempt to input any other character, as it will lead to unexpected results. Also, keep in mind that Python removes unnecessary 0s before we get the input, and there is currently nothing we can do about that. Besides, everything should work.
