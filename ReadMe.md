This is a calculator that is smart enough to round to the correct number of
significant digits when multiplying or dividing, and the correct decimal place
when adding or subtracting. It puts the answer in scientific notation if
necessary, and it can also perform calculations with units and unit conversion.

Although this project is marked with the GNU General Public License, feel free
to contact me via chingtheprogrammer@icloud.com if you want me to add or change
anything.

Note: This calculator is made with many exceptions, meaning that it should not
return any errors. Therefore, if you ever run into an error (red text printed by
python that stops the code), please report back.

Sincerely,
